## Attemp to Use Garden SDK

### Approach

We tried working with garden sdk by initialising an backend in express first.
We were able to retrieve the data and show it in the console.
Unfortunately, we were not able to perform swap.

In frontend, we were able to connect metamask wallet and make basic connections with Garden SDK
but again we were unable to perform swap.

We are still trying to see how this works and might get all the things on point in few days.
Meanwhile please judge us on the basis of approach and work we were able to do in this short span of time.
